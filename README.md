# AnimatedColorPicker

This is a color picker library for Android. It is used to pick from an array of colors. 


Custom transition animations can be used to create additional inputs after the user selects a color.
The library includes a basic ColorNamingState that can be used to receieve a name for a color.
To create a new animation all you have to do is subclass BaseState and fill out the reequired animation detatils.
